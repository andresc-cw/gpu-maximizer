# Marketing System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a simple, progressive marketing system inspired by Universal Paperclips. Players upgrade through 16 marketing levels (0-15) with each level becoming progressively more expensive and unlocking higher job volume and value multipliers.

## Design Philosophy
- **Single Button Interface**: Like Universal Paperclips, marketing is controlled by one simple upgrade button
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each level costs more but provides stronger benefits
- **Realistic Milestones**: Based on actual cloud GPU provider (CoreWeave-style) marketing evolution
- **Clear Feedback**: Shows current level, benefits, and next upgrade cost

## Marketing Levels (0-15)

## How It Works

### Backend (`game/marketing.py`)
- `MARKETING_LEVELS`: Array of 16 level definitions with costs, unlock requirements, and multipliers
- `MarketingManager`: 
  - Tracks current level (starts at 0)
  - Validates upgrade eligibility (cash + revenue requirements)
  - Calculates cumulative multipliers
  - Returns current and next level data for UI

### Game Integration (`game/game_state.py`)
- Marketing multipliers applied to job generation:
  - `job_spawn_multiplier`: Affects job spawn interval (faster spawning)
  - `job_value_multiplier`: Increases job payouts
  - `sla_extension`: Extra time before SLA penalties (levels 11, 15)
- `upgrade_marketing()`: Handles level-up purchases

### API (`app.py`)
- `/api/action` with `type: 'upgrade_marketing'`: Triggers level upgrade
- Marketing data included in game state serialization

### UI (Marketing Shop Tab)
**Location**: Shop â†’ ðŸ“ˆ Marketing tab

**Display**:
- Current level name and description
- Current bonuses: Job volume %, Job value %, SLA buffer (if any)
- Next level preview
- Single upgrade button showing cost and unlock requirement

**Button States**:
- Enabled: Player has enough cash and met revenue requirement
- Disabled (locked): Haven't reached revenue milestone
- Disabled (poor): Reached milestone but can't afford
- Max level: No more upgrades available

## Progression Curve

| Level | Cost | Total Spent | Unlock Revenue |
|-------|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | $2K | $2K | $5K |
| 5 | $20K | $47K | $80K |
| 10 | $100K | $375K | $500K |
| 15 | $350K | $1.285M | $3M |

**Design Notes**:
- Early levels are cheap and accessible (encourage experimentation)
- Mid-game becomes expensive (strategic choices matter)
- Late-game is very expensive but extremely powerful (5x jobs, 4x value)
- Total investment to max: $1,285,000

## Educational Value

Players learn about:
- **Marketing funnel evolution**: Organic â†’ Social â†’ Paid â†’ Sales â†’ Partnerships
- **B2B go-to-market**: Technical content, conferences, case studies, enterprise sales
- **Real costs**: Conference sponsorships ($20K-$150K), sales headcount ($40K-$100K)
- **Platform strategy**: Integrations create distribution channels
- **Brand building**: From unknown startup to industry leader

## Testing

1. Start game and reach $5K revenue
2. Navigate to Shop â†’ Marketing tab
3. Click "Upgrade Marketing ($2,000)"
4. Observe faster job spawning
5. Continue upgrading as revenue milestones are reached
6. Late-game multipliers should create significant acceleration

## Files Modified/Created

**Created**:
- `game/marketing.py` (221 lines) - Marketing level system
- `context/MARKETING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (this file)

**Modified**:
- `game/game_state.py` - Added `upgrade_marketing()` method
- `app.py` - Added `upgrade_marketing` API action
- `templates/index.html` - Added Marketing tab to shop
- `static/css/style.css` - Added minimal marketing UI styles
- `static/js/ui.js` - Added `renderMarketingShop()` method
- `static/js/game.js` - Added `upgradeMarketing()` API call

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements:
- Visual feedback when levels unlock (notification)
- Marketing events (e.g., "Viral tweet: +100% jobs for 30s")
- Marketing analytics dashboard (ROI calculations)
- Tie contracts to marketing levels (e.g., "Need Level 9 for enterprise contracts")
- A/B test marketing spend vs GPU investment strategies
